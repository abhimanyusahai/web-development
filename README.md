# Web development projects

This repository contains several web development projects I have built using:
* <b>Javascript</b> (along with <b>jQuery</b>), along with <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b> on the front-end
* <b>Sinatra</b> (web framework built in <b>Ruby</b>) on the server
* <b>PostgreSQL</b> for database management

Most of these are small to mid-sized code practice projects that I've built as part of the Launchschool curriculum.
